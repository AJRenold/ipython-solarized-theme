This [Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw2.github.com/AJRenold/ipython-solarized-theme/master/sorlaized_css.ipynb?create=1) creates a Solarized theme for the IPython Notebook viewer

Once you run this notebook a new IPython Profile will be created called `solarized`. When you run IPython with this theme your theme will be nice and solarized!

```
  $ ipython notebook --profile solarized
```
